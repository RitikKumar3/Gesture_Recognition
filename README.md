# Gesture Recognition
- In this project, we build a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) model to predict five different gestures accurately.
  
## Problem Solving Methodology
> The project accomplishes the following tasks:

- Generator
> The generator can process a batch of videos as input without errors. Steps such as cropping, resizing, and normalization are performed successfully.

- Model
> Developed a model capable of training without errors, evaluated based on the total number of parameters (to ensure minimal inference time) and the accuracy achieved.

- Write-up
> A detailed procedure is followed in choosing the final model. The write-up starts with the reason for choosing the base model, then highlights the reasons and metrics considered to modify and experiment to arrive at the final model.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy by experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- Implement real-time gesture recognition using the trained model.
- Expand the dataset to include more gestures and variations.
